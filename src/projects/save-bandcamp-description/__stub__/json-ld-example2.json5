  description: 'In the spring of 2004, Clairmont formed in the unsuspecting town of College Station, TX. Immediately the band became dedicated to writing a fresh and entertaining catalog of songs. Their unique sound and truthful lyrics were selected as the title track for the Esotype Records Compilation One: The Real Life Threats of You and Me. Soon after recording their first track, Clairmont began writing and producing their first album, The Dweller EP. The release in 2005 established that Clairmont would be around for awhile and would continue to write ballads for the new millennium. The band continued to play live shows in and around Texas to promote their new record and started to gain a faithful following. Their live show is one of energy and passion as the band strives to display the image their songs are about.\r\n\r\nClairmont just finished recording their first LP entitled Strength Like Lions under the engineering and production of The Mix Lab in College Station. This new album is a major testament to all of their trials and hard work that they have put forth over the last four years.',
